### 3. Uploading the necessary files ###

You should upload the following files to your web server in a location you can access from a command line:

  * **config.xml** —this is the configuration file you just created using **example\_config.xml**.
  * **sitemap\_gen.pl** —this is the Perl script that generates your Sitemap.
  * **urllist.txt** —this file is optional; you only need to include it if you used the text file method of generating a Sitemap.

The method you use to upload these files depends on your environment. Common methods include FTP and SCP. For more information, contact your web host.

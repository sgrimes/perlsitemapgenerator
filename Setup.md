### 6. Setting up a recurring script (optional) ###

We suggest setting up the Perl Sitemap Generator to run as often as your content is changed, to a maximum frequency of once per hour.

Webmasters with a UNIX web server may consider setting this up as a [cron job](http://www.google.com/search?q=cron).

Webmasters using other platforms should contact their system administrator for help in configuring recurring scripts. You may also benefit from peer advice in the Google Sitemaps Group on [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/Google_Webmaster_Help-Sitemap?tsc=1).

You can use an HTTP request to let Google know about changes to your Sitemap. However, please make sure that you log in to [Google webmaster tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/siteoverview) with your Google Account once to manually [add your Sitemap](http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=34575&topic=8496) to your Google webmaster tools account.
